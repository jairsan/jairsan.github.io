This talk provides an overview of the Speech Translation task, what it is, its special features and how to tackle them. I then go into detail explaining two contributions of my thesis:
1) a procedure for Streaming ST evaluation, and 2) streaming-specific models with streaming history.

This talk goes into greater detail than my previous one at UPC, so you should definetly watch this one if you interested in Speech Translation.

You can listen to the talk [in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91btxw8ewcI), as well as reading the slides [here.](/files/presentation_2022_06_14_special_group.pdf)
