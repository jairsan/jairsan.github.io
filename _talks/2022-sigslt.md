This talk provides an overview of the Speech Translation task and its particularities. I then go into detail explaining two contributions of my thesis:
1) a procedure for Streaming ST evaluation, and 2) streaming-specific models with streaming history.

This talk goes into greater detail than my previous one at UPC, so you should definitely watch this one if you interested in Streaming Speech Translation.

The talk is available [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91btxw8ewcI), and you can access the slides [here.](/files/presentation_2022_06_14_special_group.pdf)
