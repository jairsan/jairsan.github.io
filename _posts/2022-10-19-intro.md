Hello world! 

I finally bit the bullet and started working on a personal website and blog.
The main
goal is to highlight interesting topics I have been working on, as well
as sharing interesting or useful tidbits I discover during my work. The standard
scientific paper is sometimes not the best medium to discuss some of the nuances
of one's research, for example due to the fact that one tends to self-select
and show only the most convincing and/or status-quo friendly version of our research as to maximize
the chance of publication. Hopefully this format will allow me to shed some
light into some of the overlooked or controversial details about research.

Unlike the typical personal website, which tends to be abandoned as soon as
the original goal is achieved (usually finding a job after graduation), I
plan to allow myself to write short posts, sometimes about seemingly 
unrelated but interesting topics, so as to keep the blog posts coming in.

Enjoy your stay and hopefully I will write something that is also interesting to you.
